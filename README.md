Alaska-Permafrost-Risk-Application
==================================================
Over the last 50 years, Alaska has warmed twice as fast as the national average. Warming air and ground temperatures, permafrost melting, and changes in the freeze/thaw patterns of the soil is affecting infrastructure.  Permafrost (soil that has been frozen more than two consecutive years) degrades at temperatures above freezing. Degrading permafrost changes the surface hydrology, saturates, and can kill boreal forests among other effects. An estimated 14% of Alaskans live in areas sensitive to permafrost degradation.  Some Alaskan communities rely on a single road or airstrip for their survival. Alaska is already feeling the effects of warming on infrastructure – changes in the permafrost layer and active top soil layer causes land to shrink and bulge; changes which causes infrastructure buckling. This app provides an infrastructure risk rating by analyzing modeled ground temperature data and modeled data of the thickness of the soil layer on top of the permafrost layer – all over a period of nearly 90 years. A user is also able to swipe the temperature layers across those 90 years to view an aggressive change in ground temperature; the view is pretty dramatic.
